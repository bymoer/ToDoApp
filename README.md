# ToDoApp
Just an attempt to demonstrate some stuff.

First of all, the styling was fast and dirty. I just needed it to look a teeny tiny better than default html :)

The tech stack is as follows:

Backend:
- Node Js
- Express
- Socket.IO

Frontend:
- React
- Typescript
- Socket.IO client
- Webpack
- Babel
- SASS / SCSS
- (other stuff - loaders and such)

Container stuff:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Version control:
- :)
- Split in submodules with this (ToDoApp as the root module for todofrontend & todobackend)
